This is a collection of methods and objects to handle electrophysiology data in the Rinberg lab.

It is organized into the following packages:

1. __Preprocess.__ This contains methods that are used to process data prior to spike sorting and to 
extract metadata from Voyeur and sync it with our electrophysiological data.
2. __Models.__ This contains definitions of objects that interact with data. See readme within the package 
for more details.
3. __Views.__ This contains objects and methods describing a PyQt5 gui that interacts with the above models.
